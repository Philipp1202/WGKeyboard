Rules for creating a layout (first six lines get ignored by the program):
1. The first new line is the name of the layout
2. The next lines are lines of characters you want to have in the layout. Type in the characters and at the end of each line "$$" and a number for the indent (how much this line should be indented from the left side)
2.1 Note that you can use a character only once and right now, you cannot use "<", because it is reserved for the backspace. Also important is that the layout must have more characters in the longest line than it has lines.
3. Use "<" and " " for the backspace and the space key (backspace key is twice as big as a normal key, the space key is 8 times as big as a normal key)
4. At the end write "-----", so that the program knows that this is the end of this layout.
